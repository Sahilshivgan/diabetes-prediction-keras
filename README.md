# Diabetes Prediction using Keras

This project demonstrates how to load a pre-trained Keras model and make predictions using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

## Files
- `test.py` – Loads the model and performs predictions.
- `model.json` – JSON file containing the model architecture.
- `model.h5` – HDF5 file containing model weights.
- `pima-indians-diabetes.csv` – Dataset used for prediction.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have the following Python packages:
   ```
   pip install numpy keras
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python test.py
   ```

## Output
Displays predictions for sample inputs from the dataset.
